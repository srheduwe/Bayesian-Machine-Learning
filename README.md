# Bayesian-Machine-Learning

This notebook is part of the final project which was done for the course "Model-based Machine Learning" at DTU.
It contains a hierachical bayesian neural network, which is taking pre-processed transport data with the transport-mode to be predicted.
By analyzing an intercept and the posterior distributions, knowledge about tendencies of cities and age groups can be gained.
